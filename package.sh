# Archive the `llvm` directory itself so the consumer extracts to <root>/llvm.
# NOT byte-reproducible yet: gzip embeds an mtime and tar records per-file mtimes, so
# rebuilding from identical pins yields a different SHA256. Deliberately deferred rather
# than half-solved -- feeding bsdtar an explicit sorted file list (the usual fix) made it
# synthesize AppleDouble ._* members from extended attributes on this NFS checkout and blew
# the artifact from 13M to 64M; neither --no-mac-metadata nor COPYFILE_DISABLE suppressed
# it. Traversal mode handles the sidecars correctly. Revisit in CI, where the filesystem has
# no AppleDouble at all, and gate any change on BOTH the SHA being stable AND the size and
# entry count being unchanged.
