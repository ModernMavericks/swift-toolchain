# Write UPSTREAM_VERSION = SWIFT_VERSION, the ONE authoritative Swift pin in pins.env.
#
# Reads the pin with sed rather than sourcing pins.env, deliberately: pins.env computes VERSION (the
# full <upstream>-mavericks.N), which is derived FROM this file. Sourcing it here would be circular.
#
# So there is still exactly one place to bump Swift -- pins.env's SWIFT_VERSION, which Renovate
# manages -- and UPSTREAM_VERSION follows it automatically. It is build-derived and gitignored;
# VERSION derives from it plus the shipped tags.
